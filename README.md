I'm Darryl, and I'm here to ask you a simple question. Is a man not entitled to his own code?

"No!" says the man writing the EULA, "it belong to the following parties and are subject to this agreement and its terms and conditions."

"No!" says the man at Microsoft, "it belongs to us until you purchase a new subscription in an overpriced user plan."

"No!" says the man at Source Forge, "it belong to everyone!"

I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose GitHub.
